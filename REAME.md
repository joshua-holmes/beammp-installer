# Unoffical BeamMP Installer

Welcome to the Unoffical BeamMP Installer! This program was created to make it easier for Linux users to install and run the BeamMP (BeamNG.drive multiplayer) mod on Linux devices! The mod is currently only available for Windows.

To make BeamMP work manually, BeamMP must be installed on the same Proton prefix that BeamNG is installed on, then BeamMP must be run using Steam's Experimental version of Proton. If it is not done correctly, BeamMP may run with distracting black boxes scattered around the map, or it may not run at all.

This installer comes with a full GUI that provides a user-friendly way to do one or both of the following things:
1. Correctly install BeamMP
2. Install a custom BeamMP launcher that makes it easy to run BeamMP on Linux
